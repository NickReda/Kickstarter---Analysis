## Overview of Project and Purpose
In this project, we were tasked with analyzing the relationship between the launch date of a campaign and the outcome of the campaign as well as the relationship between the outcome a campaign and the goal amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenges I faced during this project were the issues with the manipulated spreadsheet from Module 1 along with learning how to properly insert a line graph using only select data from a dataset.
