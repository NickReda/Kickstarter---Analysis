# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project and Purpose
In this project, we were tasked with analyzing the relationship between the launch date of a campaign and the outcome of the campaign as well as the relationship between the outcome a campaign and the goal amount. Specifically, we used to sub-category of "plays" to analyze the various outcomes of campaigns.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to see in which goal amount range had the most successful, failed, and canceled campaigns in terms of percenatge when using the sub-category of "plays."
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To analyze the relationship between the outcomes of campaigns and the luanch date, I needed to create a pivot table which showed successful, failed, canceled, and grand total of campaigns broken down my months. After filtering the data by the category of theater, the pivot chart looked like this:

Using this pivot chart, I was able to create of a line graph which helped visually demonstarte which month was best to launch a campaign for the category of theater based on the number of successfull campaigns for each month.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To analyze the relationship between the outcome of camapigns and funding goals, I needed to create a range for funding goals. Doing this would demonstrate in which range the campaigns filtered by the sub-category of "plays" were most successful or unsuccessful by percentage. Using the countifs function, I was able to filter the data to count the number of successful or failed campaigns by the range, outcome, and sub-category. After doing this, I eneded up with a table:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenges I faced during this project were the issues with the manipulated spreadsheet from Module 1 along with learning how to properly insert a line graph using only select data from a dataset. I overcame these challeneges by refering back to the original, non-manipulated, data set to ensure that line graph in the instructions match the one I created. After some trial and error, I was able to figure out how to select only certian data using the chart design tab.
