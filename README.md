# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign
Using the kickstarter data set, we were able to analyse the average goal amount as well as the average pledged amount for each campaign. We were also able to highlight the types of camapigns that were successfull along with those that were unsuccessful. Using the given data, we were also able to calculate the standard deviation of the goal amount for succesfull/unsuccesful campaigns as well as the standard deviation of the pledged amount for succesfull/unsuccessful campaigns.
